						Whether you are a Consultancy, Advertising/Marketing firm, Accountancy, or other Professional Service firm, your best deliverables are grounded in a thorough understanding of how your client's company fits into their market, as well as the nuances of their operations and brand.  Unfortunately, reports and papers don't capture the granularity and relevancy needed for today's fast changing markets.  ENG supports your learning process by providing global access to experts from all points on the supply chain, across all industries.
